"""
Interactive mode command for DeployX.

Provides a complete setup and deployment workflow in a single command.
Combines initialization and deployment with retry logic and error recovery.

This mode is ideal for:
- First-time users who want guided setup
- Quick deployments without multiple commands
- Ensuring deployment succeeds before exiting

Example:
    >>> from commands.interactive import interactive_command
    >>> success = interactive_command("./my-project")
